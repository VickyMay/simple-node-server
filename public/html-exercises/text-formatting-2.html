        <h1>Hello, Friends!</h1>
        <p>My name is <strong>Vicky May L. Guinayen</strong> but you can just call me <em>Vicky</em>. I was born on May 25, 1996 in <address>Agawa, Besao, Mt. Province.</address> I like reading books and watching movies.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>I entered high school at <abbr =title "Ifugao Provincial Science High School">IPSHS</abbr> and currently, I am taking up BS Agribusiness Management in <abbr =title "University of the Philippines Los Banos">UPLB</abbr>. Although I like reading, I do not have a favorite. I just love mystery books. I started out by reading <cite>Nancy Drew</cite> books by Carolyn Keene and <cite>Hardy Boys</cite> by Franklin Dixon. At school, I learn a lot from the peple I meet and from my teachers. Recently, my friend and I like one of the statements of our finance teacher which is <q>Too little knowledge is dangerous.</q></p>
