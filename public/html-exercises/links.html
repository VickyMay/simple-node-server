        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>One of my favorite movies is <a href="https://youtu.be/rAsBlmSIksk"> Miracle in Cell No. 7 (2013)</a>. This movie has many great stories. One of which is the strong love between a father and a daughter. When I just feel like crying, this is what I love to watch.</li>
                <li>Another favorite movie is <a href="https://youtu.be/xvszmNXdM4w"> 3 Idiots (2009).</a> I just love the story of friendship, and passion in this movie. A very inspiring movie, I say. Whenever I watch this movie, I get inspired and there are a lot of learnings from this movie. </li>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/lTNMJh_mWR4"> Walking on Sunshine (2014)</a> is also one of my top favorite musical movies. What I love about this movie is that it features the greatest hits of the 80's. Whenever I watch this movie, I can't help to sing along to the songs.</li></li>
