Practically everyone reads blogs now, whether they’re “official” news blogs associated with traditional news media, topic-based blogs related to one’s work or hobbies, or blogs purely for entertainment, just about anyone you ask has at least one favorite blog.     But it wasn’t always so. Blogs have a relatively short history, even when compared with the history of the Internet itself.     And it’s only in the past five to ten years that they’ve really taken off and become an important part of the online landscape.";

document.getElementById("par2").innerHTML = "It’s generally recognized that the first blog was Links.net, created by Justin Hall, while he was a Swarthmore College student in 1994. Of course, at that time they weren’t called blogs, and he just referred to it as his personal homepage.";

document.getElementById("par6").innerHTML = "The original blogs were updated manually, often linked from a central home page or archive. This wasn’t very efficient, but unless you were a programmer who could create your own custom blogging platform, there weren’t any other options to begin with.";
