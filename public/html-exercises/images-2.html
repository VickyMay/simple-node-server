        <p><h2>Getting to Know More About Vicky!</h2></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/"><img src="images/baby4.jpg" alt="Baby Pic" width="150px" height="150px" align="right"></a> <br><br>When I was a baby my parents say that I looked like a boy because I didn't have much hair that is why they had my ears pierced. I was born in Agawa, Mt. Province but after some years, my family moved to Pagui, Pedlisan, Maddela, Quirino where I had the most of my childhood memories. But after five years, after finishing third grade, my family moved again to Nayon, Lamut, Ifugao where I spent the rest of my elementary years and where we live until now.</p>

My school was two rides away from home that's why my parents decided to let me stay at a boarding house. But after a while, I frequently went home (even during school days) that's why my parents just decided to let me go to school by commuting. Also, it is in high school where I met the most bizarre and craziest friends. There were only 36 of us classmates during first year high school and only 27 of us graduated. We were only few that's why all of us were really close that until now, we see to it that every year, we always have a reunion.</p>

I also learn a lot about myself which I didn't know I have in me like may pagkasenti pala ako, may pagka-introvert pala ako, at marami pang iba. Sumali din ako sa org na di ko akalain na magagawa ko pala at sa org na ito, it helped me explore Elbi more. Nakapunta ako sa iba't-ibang lugar dito sa Elbi dahil sa org ko. Iniisip ko ngayon, kung hindi ako nag-org baka hanggang ngayon, wala akong kaalam alam sa Elbi o baka nasa dorm lang ako most of my time. Now, I am a senior student and I hope to graduate on time. :D

But nothing is certain yet so whatever will be will be as long as I am happy and contented. Whatever God is planning for me, so be it. </p>
